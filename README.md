# Co-op Survey Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes survey responses from students in co-op programs to provide insights for both incoming students and current co-op students to get a sense of how good the co-op program at the University of Guelph is.

Only degree programs and majors with more than 3 responses will be used for subgroup analysis.
